                <p><strong>Blobby nom nom</strong></p>

                <h3 class="red">Discovered by / at:</h3>
                <p>Discovered by student <strong>Luelle</strong> ‚Äî somewhere between 2 AM and 4 AM while trying to ‚Äújust make bacteria move‚Äù in p5.js. She has zero clue what exactly happened but it looked kinda alive, so yeah ‚Äî accidental discovery!</p>

                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p>
                    A one-of-a-kind digital organism found only in Luelle‚Äôs chaotic p5.js petri dish.  
                    She probably combined noise(), a for loop, and sheer confusion to accidentally summon this thing.  
                    When a human (you) touches the environment, a small penicillin-type mold emerges ‚Äî aka *Blobby nom nom* ‚Äî and starts eatin‚Äô the surrounding bacteria.

            <div class="right">
                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>
                    It lives in a noisy bacterial field made up of soft glowing blue strands (the background).  
                    Those strands? That‚Äôs its food.  
                    When it‚Äôs hungry, you‚Äôll see it erase the bacteria around it in a lil soft halo.  
                    Once the bacteria are all gone ‚Äî boom, it stops growing. Full belly, nap time. üò¥
                </p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>
                    A glowing blue blob that slowly expands in layers like jelly under water.  
                    It has a faint aura that eats up the background within its glow radius.  
                    When you drag it, it leaves smooth trails like slime being pulled across a microscope slide.
                </p>

                <h3 class="green">Key Characteristics:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Feeds on nearby bacteria (the flowy noise background)</li>
                    <li>Stops growing when it‚Äôs full</li>
                    <li>Soft halo = digestive zone</li>
                    <li>Follows mouse when dragged</li>
                    <li>Possibly sentient? hard to tell tbh</li>

                <span class="yellow">What we know so far about Blobby nom nom?</span><br><br>
                It‚Äôs a self-growing noise-based lifeform that accidentally learned how to eat its own environment.  
                Created from a simple for loop and noise(), it now behaves like a digital mold ‚Äî expanding until it devours all bacteria within reach.  
                Researchers (aka Luelle) hypothesize it feeds by absorbing the background‚Äôs noise energy.  
                Once everything nearby is gone, it just‚Ä¶ stops. Like, completely.  
                No drama. Just chill. Until you spawn it again.<br><br>

                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span><br>
                1. Click to summon your own mold blob. <br>
                2. Drag gently ‚Äî it vibes with slow motion.<br>
                3. Don‚Äôt panic if it stops moving. It‚Äôs probably digesting. <br>
                4. If it disappears, just click again. Life finds a way.<br>
                5. Do not try to feed it too fast. (It lags. And maybe cries.)<br><br>

                *bloby nom nom* might be the first recorded case of an artificial organism developing hunger in code.  
                Scientists are still arguing whether this counts as ‚Äúlife‚Äù or just bad variable naming.
